Once the user runs the program, the following will be shown in the console:
* The beginning queue
* The removed front element
* The front of the queue after removing the front element
* The queue after the front element is removed
* If the queue is empty or not
* How many elements are in the current queue

The program will then ask for the infix expression
* The user will be able to create an expression of their choice containing numbers and letters as well as the following operators: (  )  {  }  [  ]  /  *  %  +  -  
* After, the infix expression is solved and the postfix expression will be displayed for the user

NOTE: If the user inputs unbalanced parentheses (i.e: (} or [)), the return will not be the postfix expression but rather "The expression is invalid."
